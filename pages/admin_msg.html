	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey guys! I've been working on other NT projects outside 
	these leaderboards. One of which is a shop leaks engine that I created for my 
	friend's Discord bot - Magmal. I recommend you try it out! Magmal offers all sorts 
	of useful features for NitroType/NitroMath. Besides auto-generated item shop leaks, 
	it also allows you to view user/team stats, view more details on cars, connect your 
	account with easy registration/verification, and get auto-updated roles in your server!

	to add Magmal to your Discord server. And here's the Magmal Support server:
