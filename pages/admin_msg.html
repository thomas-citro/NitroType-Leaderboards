		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ðŸš¨ ATTENTION! ðŸš¨ In an effort to crack-down on the recent 
		increase in cheating, teams are now flagged if there are any members detected as 
		botting. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Captains</span> - it is your responsibility 
		to ensure that botters are kicked from the team. Botting will not be tolerated, and 
		your team will be banned from the leaderboards if action is not taken. Now, occasionally, 
		players may be falsely flagged because this anti-cheat system is not perfect. Please 
		don't take it personally - submit a ban appeal form <a href="https://forms.gle/TS2tA2wFn91HzZgo8" target="_blank" class="video-link">here</a>
		to resolve the issue. While your appeal is under review, your team won't be penalized 
		for your flag.
