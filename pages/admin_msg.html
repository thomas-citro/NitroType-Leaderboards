		Hey guys. I'd like to give a summary of what's happened over the past 2 days so 
		that everyone is caught up and understands what to expect from ntleaderboards 
		moving forward. As of November 26th, Nitro Type made a change that has blocked almost
		everyone's ability to scrape from their API. NTLeaderboards relies on this API in 
		order to pull updated user/team data for each leaderboard. I've contacted the 
		NT admins and am currently waiting to see how they can help to get this resolved.
		Unfortunately, I don't know how long this will take, as it depends on when I hear 
		from them and what they say. In the meantime, I will be manually updating the season 
		leaderboards each day until the season is over. Every other leaderboard will not 
		be updated for the time being. Thanks everyone for your support!
