	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello everyone! After nearly 2 months, I have finally updated the leaderboards! I have
	been hard at work this past week on developing a revamped bot-detection system to foster
	fair leaderboards free from cheaters. This system is much more advanced than the anti-cheat 
	system that I had implemented in the past. It has resulted in an initial count of 339 teams 
	and 10,688 users banned from my leaderboards. I am still very much in the beginning 
	stages of this, so I expect to make major improvements to this anti-cheat system moving 
	forward. As such, it is not perfect, so contact me if you believe that someone was 
	banned falsely.
	</br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For now, expect to see these leaderboards updated about once every week. I will let you 
	guys know if anything changes. The 7-day and 24-hour leaderboards will be down for the 
	time-being as well.
