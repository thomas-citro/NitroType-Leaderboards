		Hey guys, it was brought to my attention that some of the NitroMath leaderboards
		have been acting buggy recently. Well, after looking into it, I found the problem.
		The NitroMath season API has not been updating for the past 3 days or so. I'm fairly 
		confident that this is a result of the admins extending the season out another week, 
		so they likely forgot to mark in the NitroMath API of this change to the season 
		end date. I have checked to see if this similar issue has occurred with NitroType season 
		stats - fortunately, it appears to be fully functional. So, the season NitroMath leaderboards
		are effectively concluded. Also, I will be disabling the 24-hour/7-day NitroMath leaderboards 
		since they rely on the season API.
