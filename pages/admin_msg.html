	Hey guys, unfortunately I haven't made much progress over the last few weeks on 
	restoring updates to these leaderboards. It seems like the admins are quite busy,
	and so it has been difficult for me to get in contact with them. If things don't
	progress soon, I plan to make a one-time manual update to these leaderboards since
	we haven't seen an automated update for awhile now. I will keep you guys posted before
	the end of this week. Thanks again for your patience. And don't lose hope!
