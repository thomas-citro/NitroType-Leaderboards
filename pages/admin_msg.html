	Hello everyone! So since the admins are pretty busy and haven't been very responsive lately,
	I've decided that I will be performing manual weekly updates to the leaderboards until
	I am able to restore daily updates again! The 7-day and 24-hour leaderboards will still 
	be down, but everything else I plan to manually update every week. The first manual 
	update I plan to complete before the end of this week. :)
