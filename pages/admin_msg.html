		Hey guys! It has been forever since I've updated these leaderboards or been involved
		in the NT community in general. I decided to bring back the leaderboards with a new
		update! Moving forward, I would like to have semi-frequent updates to the leaderboards.
		However, there are a few caveats: I will no longer be taking any ban appeals, which means
		that any currently banned users will not be able to be unbanned. Also, due to my busy
		schedule and the fact that NT has removed their season API, we will not have any season,
		weekly, or daily leaderboards. I will keep you all posted as I get a better idea of 
		what's to come in the future! 😎
