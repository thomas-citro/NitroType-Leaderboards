	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ðŸš¨ ATTENTION! ðŸš¨ You may have noticed a new feature 
	implemented into the Top Teams page: flags. In an effort to crack-down on the recent 
	increase in cheating, teams are now flagged if there are any members detected as 
	botting. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Captains</span> - it is your responsibility 
	to ensure that botters are kicked from the team. Botting will not be tolerated, and 
	your team will be banned from the leaderboards if action is not taken. Now, occasionally, 
	players may be falsely flagged because this anti-cheat system is not perfect. Please 
	don't take it personally - submit a ban appeal form <a href="https://forms.gle/TS2tA2wFn91HzZgo8" target="_blank" class="video-link">here</a>
	to resolve the issue. While your appeal is under review, your team won't be penalized 
	for your flag.
