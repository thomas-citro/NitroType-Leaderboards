		I'm glad to announce that the leaderboards have returned! However, due to the new 
		restrictions made to Nitro Type's API, I've had to make some changes.. On the plus 
		side: season, 7-day, and 24-hour leaderboards will still be updated daily. On 
		the down side: hall of fame, rarest loot, site stats, and some other 
		things will be updated less frequently in order to stay within the allowed number 
		of API requests. I have it set up so that data gets updated in a queue. So, some 
		user/team data will be updated one day, and then other user/team data gets updated 
		the next day, and so on... So, I ask that you bear with me and not be surprised if 
		there are some things on the leaderboards that aren't quite up-to-date. I've ensured 
		that this update queue is functional and prioritizes certain data updates in order 
		to keep everything running smoothly.
