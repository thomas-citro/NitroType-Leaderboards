	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of 7/12/24, data updates for these leaderboards are 
	restored to a weekly basis. New developments have also been made - including a revamped
	bot-detection system to foster fair leaderboards free from cheaters. It is not perfect, 
	so feel free to contact me if you believe that someone was banned falsely. I will continue
	to work on improving this anti-cheat system moving forward. The 7-day and 24-hour 
	leaderboards will be down for the time-being, but hopefully we will see these return
	in the near future.
